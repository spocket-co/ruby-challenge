## Deliverable
- Create a new public repo on Github
- Push all the code and instructions to run the app and how to test it.
- Send the link to your tech recruiter

## Additional information 
You should consider rate limits and api delays, RoR best practices like, services, not fat models, tests and how this app will be deployed.

## Which tech should you use
At Spocket we're crazy for good stuff and new technologies that can add value to our business. 

We are not really attached to RoR, that's why we expect you to feel comfortable learning new technologies.

Although, most of our backend was built using RoR and that's why this challenge must be done using Ruby on Rails.

## Questions 
If you have any questions, feel free to send a message to your tech recruiter.
